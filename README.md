## Project Description:

We use gestures in this project to browse images acquired through radiology. Gestures are hand motions used in nonverbal communication. The primary means of interaction between humans and computers nowadays are keyboards and pointing devices like mice. However, doctors and nurses in intensive care units (ICUs) frequently transfer infections through the use of computer keyboards and mice. Humans are adept at deciphering both body and sign language. This is conceivable because of how vision and synaptic contacts developed throughout the course of brain development.
